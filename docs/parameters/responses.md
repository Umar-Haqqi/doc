# Configure Your Journey Flow

### *2. Configure Your Journey Flow*  

After logging into your Idenfo dashboard, the next step is to configure your *Journey Flow*.  

#### *How to Configure a Journey Flow*:  
1. Navigate to the *Journey Flow Builder* section in your dashboard.  
2. Select the steps you want to include in your flow. For example:  
   - *Document Verification*  
   - *Proof of Address Verification*  
   - *Facial Verification (Selfie)*  
   - *AML Screening* (optional)  
3. Customize each step to match your business requirements, such as:  
   - Document types (passports, IDs, etc.)  
   - Facial verification thresholds.  
   - Optional integrations like AML or government database checks.  

Save your journey flow once you've configured it. This flow will now guide your SDK implementation.
