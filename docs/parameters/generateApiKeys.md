# Generate Your API Keys

### *3. Generate API Keys*  

To integrate the Idenfo Identity Verification SDK with your application, you need to generate API keys.  

#### *Steps to Generate API Keys*:  
1. Go to the *API Key Management* section in your Idenfo dashboard.  
2. Click on *Generate New Key* and select the desired permissions and scope for the key.  
3. Copy the API key and store it securely. You will use this key to authenticate your SDK integration.  

*Important*: Do not share your API keys publicly or expose them in your application code. Use environment variables or secure key storage practices for production environments.

### *4. Download and Integrate the SDK*  

Once your account is set up, journey flow configured, and API keys generated, download the appropriate SDK for your platform:  

- *Android* SDK: [Download Here](#)  
- *iOS* SDK: [Download Here](#)  
- *Web* SDK: [Download Here](#)  

Refer to the platform-specific integration guides for step-by-step instructions on integrating the SDK into your application.

### *5. Test Your Integration*  

Use the sandbox environment to test your SDK integration and ensure the journey flow works as expected. The sandbox allows you to simulate real-world scenarios, such as:  
- Document uploads.  
- Facial verification.  
- API responses for AML checks.  

Testing your setup in a controlled environment ensures a smooth transition to production.

### *6. Move to Production*  

Once you’re satisfied with your testing, you can switch to the production environment by:  
1. Navigating to the *Environment Settings* in your dashboard.  
2. Switching your API key usage from *Sandbox* to *Production*.  

Ensure all configurations are finalized before moving to production to avoid disruptions.

With these steps, your integration with Idenfo's Identity Verification SDK will be up and running, delivering secure and seamless identity verification experiences for your users.
