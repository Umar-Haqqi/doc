### Real-Time Liveness Detection
Idenfo’s advanced liveness detection technology ensures that every verification process is safeguarded against spoofing attempts. By analyzing subtle movements such as blinking, head tilts, and facial expressions, our SDK confirms the physical presence of the user in real time. This feature is indispensable for remote onboarding, guaranteeing the integrity of your verification process by preventing the use of photos, videos, or masks.


### AI-Powered Face Matching
Leverage state-of-the-art facial comparison technology to validate user identities with unparalleled accuracy. Our SDK matches the user’s live image with their official ID photo, ensuring that only legitimate users gain access. This advanced feature significantly reduces identity fraud risks, giving businesses confidence in the authenticity of their customer base while providing a seamless user experience.

### Multi Document Support
Simplify the onboarding process with support for a wide range of identity documents. From national IDs and passports to residence visas, our SDK ensures compatibility with various formats and languages. The intuitive document upload feature facilitates smooth and hassle-free verification for users from diverse backgrounds, helping businesses extend their reach globally.

    - #### Custom Document Training:
        If your organization requires support for specific document types not currently supported, our AI models can be trained to recognize and validate these custom documents. This ensures flexibility and adaptability to meet your unique business needs.

### Comprehensive Anti-Fraud Screening
Enhance security with our robust anti-fraud detection module. By meticulously analyzing key document elements such as watermarks, logos, and signatures, the SDK identifies potential forgeries and ensures document authenticity. This automated process minimizes manual intervention, speeding up verification while maintaining the highest standards of accuracy and reliability.

### Adaptive User Experience with Configurable Presets
Deliver a personalized verification journey tailored to your business needs. Configurable presets enable businesses to select the exact features they want in the SDK directly through the Idenfo portal, making it easy to configure workflows, control verification parameters, and align the user experience with specific compliance or operational requirements—all without compromising security or precision.

See the next section on "Flows" for more information on how to configure these features.

    #### Namescreening:
        Idenfo’s namescreening solution provides comprehensive compliance by featuring:

            - Global Sanction Lists
            - Local Black Lists
            - Politically Exposed Persons (PEP) Lists
            - Real-Time Adverse Media

These features can be configured and monitored through the Idenfo Direct web portal, ensuring an efficient and streamlined compliance process for your business.

### Risk Rating
Our risk rating module allows you to assess and manage customer risk using both default parameters and custom-defined metrics. Businesses can configure these parameters directly on the Idenfo Direct web portal, ensuring they meet specific regulatory and operational requirements.

### OCR Integration
Accelerate onboarding with Optical Character Recognition (OCR) that transforms text from uploaded documents into digital data instantly. By eliminating manual data entry, this feature enhances accuracy and reduces the time required for processing applications. The OCR technology seamlessly integrates with other verification processes, making the entire workflow more efficient and user-friendly.
