### *Steps in the Journey Flow*

#### *1. Document Verification Step*  
This step enables users to capture and upload an image of their identity document, such as a passport, driver’s license, or national ID card. Idenfo’s advanced technology authenticates the document and extracts essential information accurately.  

- *Key Features*:  
  - Real-time document type recognition.  
  - Instant feedback for capturing high-quality images.  
  - Supports single-sided and double-sided document scans.  

---

#### *2. Proof of Address Verification Step*  
Users provide proof of their current address by submitting documents such as utility bills, bank statements, or lease agreements. This step verifies the authenticity of the document and validates the residential address provided.  

- *Accepted Documents Include*:  
  - Utility bills (electricity, water, gas).  
  - Bank or credit card statements.  
  - Rental or lease agreements.  

For a comprehensive list of accepted documents, refer to the *Proof of Address Guidelines*.

#### *3. Facial Verification (Selfie) Step*  
In this step, users capture a live selfie for biometric verification. This ensures that the individual presenting the identity document is its legitimate owner.  

- *Selfie Capture Guidance*:  
  - Ensure proper lighting with no face obstructions.  
  - Follow on-screen prompts, such as blinking or smiling.  

Idenfo’s state-of-the-art facial recognition technology performs a real-time match with the ID photo and uses liveness detection to prevent fraudulent attempts with photos or videos.

#### *4. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Screening* (Optional)  
This optional step performs rigorous checks to screen user information against global watchlists, including:  
- Politically Exposed Persons (PEP) lists.  
- Sanctions databases.  
- Anti-Money Laundering (AML) lists.  

*Note*: This feature requires prior configuration with our support team and is available as an add-on service.

#### *5. Government Database Integration* (Optional)  
To enhance the verification process, Idenfo can cross-verify user details against official government databases, adding an additional layer of authenticity and compliance.
